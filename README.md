## General Info
This project consists essentially of an e-commerce website where the user or customer can view all the options available in our cake flavors catalog. These flavors can be both sweet and savory.

The dynamic aspect of this is that the user will, initially, be able to view our complete catalog and also have the option to filter flavors by "Sweet" or "Savory".

They will have the ability to access the details of each flavor, view the available stock and cake price, as well as select the desired quantity.

Once they have finished their purchase, if they navigate to the shopping cart emoji at the top right, they will be able to see the chosen options and the total price to be paid. At this point, two scenarios will be presented.

The first scenario is that they complete the purchase, where they will need to enter their personal information to proceed with the purchase. The second scenario involves removing the selected items from the shopping cart.
